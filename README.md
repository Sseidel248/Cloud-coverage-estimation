# Master Thesis 
## Cloud coverage estimation
This project is part of my master's thesis in the field of "Driver behavior monitoring for energy optimization and accident prevention" at the Technical University of Berlin. It deals with identification of the percentage of cloud cover at a location at a specific point in time.

I mainly worked with data from the DWD (German Weather Service).
